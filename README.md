#Stock Analysis With VBA
##Overview of Project
 The purpose of this project was to refractor code with VBA to more efficiently run an analysis on stock data from 2017 and 2018 to determine which stocks are worth investing in. The dataset included information from 12 different stocks including the ticker ID, the date the stock was sold, the opening and closing prices, the highest and lowest prices and the volume of the stock for both 2017 and 2018. From the raw data the total daily volume and the return was obtained for each stock. The code had already been created to obtain these findings during a previous module, the goal of this project was to edit the VBA script be able to run it faster for both years. 

##Results
### Stock Performance Comparison Based on Year
From on the table formulated from the VBA script that was written, it can be concluded that the stocks performed better in 2017 than they did in 2018. With the exception of the stock TERP, all other stocks had a positive return in 2017. However, in 2018 all stocks besides ENPH and RUN had negative returns.  

### Code Execution Time 
During the refractoring process, the code was edited and condensed in order for it to run quicker and more efficiently. The part of the code that was refractored had to do with obtaining the total daily volume and return output from the 2017 and 2018 raw data. Code to record the time in which it took the analysis to run was also included to see which version of the code ran faster.
